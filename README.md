## Workflow

2. Make sure to pull the latest changes: `git pull`
3. Create a new branch with the format: `git checkout -b <your name>/<name of feature>`
4. Commit as much as you can to avoid losing code
5. Always push your latest changes to the repository
6. Once you are done with your feature, submit a pull request on GitHub from your branch to the `dev` branch

## Reminders

- Please turn off your code formatter for this workspace
- As much as possible, only edit the files for the feature that are assigned to you to avoid merge conflicts
- Follow the intended file directory structure
- Use appropriate file names, CSS IDs, and CSS classes
- Make sure your code looks **exactly** like it does on Figma, including all exact values, margins, fonts, etc.
